# Ward: Security Audit

_Root_: `Geist-Agent`  
Findings: **0 vulns** (C:0 H:0 M:0 L:0), **0 secrets**, **0 risky patterns**

## Recommendations

**Top Priorities (24â€“48h)**

- **Ensure Continuous Security Monitoring**: Implement automated security scans to continuously monitor the repository for new vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations.
  
- **Code Quality Checks**: Integrate static code analysis tools like SonarQube or CodeQL to automatically identify potential code quality issues.

**Concrete Fixes**

- **Continuous Security Scanning**
  ```yaml
  # Example GitHub Actions workflow
  jobs:
    scan_repo:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
          with:
            token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
            file: ./reports/security-report.json
  ```

- **Static Code Analysis Integration**
  ```yaml
  # Example GitHub Actions workflow for SonarQube
  jobs:
    static_analysis:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Setup SonarQube
          uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scanner-github-action@master
          with:
            token: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
  ```

**Hardening Next**

- **Implement Repository Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive parts of the repository.
- **Configure Secure Secrets Management**: Use a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for secure storage and retrieval of secrets.
- **Enable Code Reviews**: Set up pull request reviews to enforce code quality and security standards.

These steps will ensure immediate visibility into potential security issues while laying the groundwork for ongoing improvements.
