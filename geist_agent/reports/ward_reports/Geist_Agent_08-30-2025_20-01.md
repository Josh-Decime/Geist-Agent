# Ward: Security Audit

_Root_: `Geist-Agent`  
Findings: **0 vulns** (C:0 H:0 M:0 L:0), **0 secrets**, **0 risky patterns**

## Recommendations

No dependency vulnerabilities, secrets, or risky patterns were detected in this scan.

**Keep in mind:** absence of findings â‰  absolute security. Threats evolve and coverage is imperfect.
- Re-scan regularly (after dependency updates and before releases).
- Enable automated dependency updates and lockfile hygiene.
- Consider a CI policy to block new secrets or High/Critical CVEs.
