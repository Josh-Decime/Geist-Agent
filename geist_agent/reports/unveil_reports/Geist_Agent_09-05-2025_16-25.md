## Overview

# Unveil: Codebase Map - Overview

Unveil is designed to provide detailed insights into software projects through codebase analysis. The entry point for running Unveil functionalities locally is in `geist_agent/src/geist_agent/main.py`. Key components include:

- **Crew Configuration**: Defined in `unveil_agent.py`, managing specific tasks and agents.
- **Unveil Runner**: Conducting codebase analysis and summarization, located in `unveil_runner.py`.
- **Scrying Agent**: For research and report generation, implemented in `scrying.py`.

The system collaborates through CLI interfaces provided by `poltern.py` for functionalities like scrying, diagnostics, and security audits. The Ward module focuses on security scans and reports, with entry points in `ward_runner.py` and utilities in `ward/__init__.py`. Notable patterns include the use of a CrewAI framework for agent configuration and OSV-Scanner API integration for vulnerability scanning.

Health checks and diagnostics are handled by `doctor.py`, while utility functions for file system operations and environment variable handling reside in `utils.py`. Overall, Unveil aims to provide comprehensive security and codebase insights through structured and modular components.
