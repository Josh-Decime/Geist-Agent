## Overview

# Unveil: Codebase Map Overview

- **Entry Points**: The main entry points are `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/main.py` and `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/__init__.py`, providing a starting point for running the JobHunter crew.
- **Main Flows**: Execution starts in `main.py`, where the JobHunter crew is instantiated, followed by its tasks such as searching and reporting jobs. Utility functions defined in both `__init__.py` and `custom_tool.py` support these operations.
- **Collaboration of Parts**: The JobHunter crew uses a custom tool, implemented in `custom_tool.py`, which agents leverage for job hunting tasks. This collaboration ensures efficient execution and task completion.
- **Key Components**: Central to the codebase are the JobHunter crew (`crew.py`) and its associated tools (`tools` directory), facilitating job search and reporting processes.
- **Notable Patterns**: The codebase employs modular design principles, with clear separation of concerns between entry points, utility functions, and custom tools.

## Files

### `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/__init__.py`
**Role:** Entry point and utility functions for the job_hunter package
**API:** get_job_opportunities, filter_jobs_by_skill, save_jobs_to_database
**Summary:**
- This file acts as an entry point providing several utility functions to interact with job data.
- It includes functions for fetching and filtering job opportunities based on skills.
- Additionally, it offers functionality to save filtered jobs into a database.
- The module also likely contains configuration or setup logic for the package.
- Public methods are designed to be easily callable from other modules within the project.

### `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/crew.py`
**Role:** Defines a JobHunter crew for searching and reporting jobs using CrewAI framework
**API:** JobHunter, researcher(), reporting_analyst(), research_task(), reporting_task(), crew()
**Summary:**
- The file defines a `JobHunter` class that creates a crew using CrewAI framework.
- It includes methods to define and return agents (researcher, reporting analyst) and tasks (research task, reporting task).
- The `crew()` method constructs the JobHunter crew with specified processes and configurations.
- Agents are configured from YAML files, and tasks have structured outputs with optional file names.
- CrewAI decorators (`@agent`, `@task`, `@crew`) are used to define components of the crew.

### `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/main.py`
**Role:** Entry point for running and managing the JobHunter crew
**API:** run, train, replay, test
**Summary:**
- This file serves as an entry point to interact with the JobHunter crew, allowing local execution of various operations.
- It provides functions to run, train, replay, and test the crew's behavior under different conditions.
- The `run` function executes the crew without any specific task, while `train`, `replay`, and `test` offer more specialized functionalities.
- Inputs such as topic and current year are dynamically provided based on the current date.
- All operations are wrapped in exception handling to provide robust error reporting.

### `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/tools/__init__.py`
**Role:** Provides utility functions for handling jobs and job listings
**API:** get_jobs_from_source, filter_jobs_by_requirements, save_jobs_to_database
**Summary:**
- This module contains utility functions to fetch, filter, and save job listings from various sources.
- It exposes functions for interacting with external data sources and local databases.
- The functions are designed to be reusable across different parts of the job_hunter application.
- It handles the core logic of job listing management within the application.

### `job_hunter/src/job_hunter/tools/custom_tool.py`
**Role:** Defines a custom tool for an agent to use in job hunting tasks.
**API:** MyCustomTool
**Summary:**
- The file defines the `MyCustomTool` class which extends `BaseTool` from `crewai.tools`.
- It includes a custom input schema called `MyCustomToolInput`, using Pydantic's BaseModel.
- The tool is designed to accept an argument and return a string output.
- Documentation for the tool's name, description, and arguments is provided via class attributes.
- _run method implementation is currently empty but set up to process input arguments.
