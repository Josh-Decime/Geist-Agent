This section will examine modern philosophical contributions and how they influence individual and societal values.

## Scientific Perspectives

### Evolutionary Biology
Evolutionary biology provides insights into why life exists and what drives organisms to survive. According to Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the primary drive for survival ensures the continuation of species (Darwin, "On the Origin of Species"). This section will explore how this biological perspective informs our understanding of the meaning of life.

### Neuroscience
Neuroscience research reveals that human behavior and emotions are rooted in brain functions. Studies indicate that the reward system in the brain is activated by pleasurable experiences, contributing to subjective well-being (Berridge & Kringelbach, "Pleasure Systems in the Brain"). This section will discuss how neurological mechanisms influence our sense of purpose.

## Theological Perspectives

This section will provide an overview of these perspectives.

## Psychological Perspectives
