I was right when I said it was likely user error blocking me from running a custom CLI script to run another workflow. Python pathing is tricky, I’ve never encountered any issues like that in any other coding language/project I’ve done before. 
The issue was that it wasn't in the virtual environment that was created by the template when I tried to execute python custom_run.py & custom_run.py import was trying to run from the wrong place. When I started the project I got ahead of myself & set up a virtual environment before launching the create CrewAI command so there was a virtual environment inside another virtual environment, because I was following AI generated instructions. After I restarted the project & just followed CrewAI documentation, like I should have in the first place, I hadn't paid much attention to it having a virtual environment because the CrewAI run command worked without being in the virtual environment. 
While driving around today I listened to some python tutorials, specifically for custom CLI, but they didn’t tell me anything I hadn’t already learned from just trial & error over the last several days. Trial & error ended up being how I solved this one. I’ll keep listening to tutorials &/or find an audiobook so I can learn more about Python, since it's so common for AI & agentic projects. 
I’m glad I figured that out! Now I can develop this how I want, rather than just adhering to how the template was intended to be used. One single workflow just isn't flexible enough for how I want to utilize this.

Today was much busier than anticipated so I could only read CrewAI documentation pages Introduction, Agent, Tasks & CLI. I still really want to be able to have multiple custom commands for various workflows within the same agent system so I tried experimenting but was unsuccessful. I’m trying to force it to run python commands but it refuses. This is my first project in python so it is most likely user error, unless they are actively blocking commands outside of crewai CLI. Yesterday I reverted all the changes I attempted but today I’ll save them to review & then undo them if I cant get it to work.

I familiarized myself with the template files so I understand the code flow. The run function in main.py calls crew.py, which pulls from the agents.yaml & tasks.yaml. Simple enough, but as far as I currently understand it, the run function bottlenecks the crew into only being able to run a singular workflow. You can add more to crew.py, agents.yaml & tasks.yaml so it can accomplish much more complex tasks, but I don't yet see a way to run various different workflows to accomplish different goals.
For example, I would like to keep the research functionality that it has, that could be helpful. But I would also like to add completely different capabilities like being able to scan a codebase & summarize it. Or be able to search that codebase for functions that accomplish a certain task. Essentially making my crew work like a free, read only, version of claude code. But those would have to be 2 separate run functions that I would call. I would also need a way to input information for running it. I would also like to build out different workflows around different tools.
I have been weighing my different options to allow for various workflows within the same agent. The most obvious answer to me would be to make new .py files that mirror crew.py to run those different workflows. they could take information from the agents.yaml & tasks.yaml. Since I have a base knowledge of web development I think of it like the new .py would be my service with all the logic & the .yaml would be similar to my appstate, holding information. In main.py I could make new functions like "codescan" instead of just run, that would reference a codescan.py file.In the terminal I would run it like crewai codescan & the AI would go off scanning whatever file I manually pointed it to in the main.py.
I was looking at argparse as a solution too. That would allow me to input a new topic in as well so I could build out a research architecture with multiple LLM & instead of manually changing the topic in the main.py I could just input it in the terminal, for example crewai run --topic "Quantum Mechanics". I attempted to incorporate argparse but I get the error [Errno 2] No such file or directory. I think it is because crewai has a custom CLI. I might be able to overcome it with a setup.py file but that would be risky because I would have to pip install -e. AI says sure it's fine.. I might be brand new to python & not have much experience outside websites & small VR projects, but that seems like a good way to give myself a whole lot of problems. I don't understand this template nearly well enough. I need to read all the documentation instead of just messing around & seeing what happens like I have been.
My plan for tomorrow is to read the documentation & come up with a direction for this project that will adhere to its intended use before I try & make it do things it wasn't designed for. I keep trying to make changes beyond my understanding. I need to narrow my scope.
